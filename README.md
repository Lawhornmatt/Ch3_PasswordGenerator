## WELCOME:
This is the README.md for the Challenge THREE "Password Generator" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

This is a website featuring javascript enabling you to generate random strings of characters depending on your preferences.

Use them for a password if you so choose!

## HOW TO:
Press the button to begin making a password. <br>
Follow the prompts; the password must be between 8 and 128 characters long and use at least one character option (e.g. lowercase characters).

## P.s.:
I began greatly expanding my password generator for eventual inclusion with my portfolio. <br>
On recommendation of my TAs, I have forked my repo and aligned my code closer to the strict GIVEN-WHEN-THEN Acceptence Criteria. <br>
The homework branch, the one displayed here and in the link, are the application and code intended to be graded.
