## WELCOME:
This is the README.md for the Challenge THREE "Password Generator" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

This is a website featuring javascript enabling you to generate a random password.
I plan on the following options:

* Choose your password length
* Choose from two different password styles (random characters OR my prefered method based on XKCD)
